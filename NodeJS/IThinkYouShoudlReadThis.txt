This is a note for the Server and the Client 
+ io.on('connection') is for handle the every connection that connect to 
    socket (which is the sever is listen) [IPAddress:PortNumber] 
+ socket.on is you know


Ideas: Do we need to build a website statistic for the app, I think it is too much

#we can create more than 2 room in one socket 



One socket but 3 Room
    + One is firebase
    + One is all client except the RasPi
    + I think one more room only for the RasPi sending ack for the Ras that the server
    is recv the data
All the log from the RasPi will be send to firebase using JSON.stringfy 


------------------------------WHAT HAPPEN-------------------------------------
Server output:
    + Client (all the phones that are connected, actually one but hey ...)
    + Firebase (log all the data input by the RasPi)

Server input: 
    + RasPi (only received acknowledgement from the server)

This is a note for the Server and the Client 
+ io.on('connection') is for handle the every connection that connect to 
    socket (which is the sever is listen) [IPAddress:PortNumber] 
+ socket.on is you know


Ideas: Do we need to build a website statistic for the app, I think it is too much

#we can create more than 2 room in one socket 



One socket but diffenrent Room
    + One is firebase
    + One is all client except the RasPi
    + I think one more room only for the RasPi sending ack for the Ras that the server
    is recv the data
    + 
All the log from the RasPi will be send to firebase using JSON.stringfy
